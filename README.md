# Signals-and-Systems-Course

The purpose of this course is to introduce the fundamental concepts of **continuous-time** and **discrete-time** signals and systems. The goal is to master key mathematical tools—such as **Convolution**, the **Fourier Transform**, the **Laplace Transform**, and the **Z-Transform**—to effectively analyze the behavior of these systems.

### 1. Continuous-Time Signals
* Definition, **Power**, and **Energy** of signals
* **Linear Transformations** on signals
* Important elementary signals and the properties of the **Impulse Function**

### 2. Continuous-Time Systems
* System properties: **Memorylessness**, **Causality**, **Invertibility**, **Stability**, **Linearity**, and **Time-Invariance (LTI)**
* Analysis of **LTI Systems**
* The **Convolution Integral** and its properties
* System representation with **Linear Differential Equations**

### 3. Fourier Analysis for Continuous-Time Signals
* **Fourier Series** for periodic signals and its properties
* The **Fourier Transform** for aperiodic signals and its properties
* Applications: **LTI System Analysis**, **Filtering**, **Modulation**, and the **Nyquist Sampling Theorem**

### 4. The Laplace Transform
* Definition of the **Laplace Transform** and its **Region of Convergence (ROC)**
* Properties of the Laplace Transform
* Analysis of **LTI systems**, including stability and causality
* The **Unilateral Laplace Transform** for systems with initial conditions

### 5. Discrete-Time Signals and Systems
* Properties of **Discrete-Time Signals** and **LTI Systems**
* The **Convolution Sum**
* **Discrete-Time Fourier Transform (DTFT)** and its applications
* The **Z-Transform**, its properties, and its use in analyzing discrete-time systems
